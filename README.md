# web-scratch

I wanted a [web page](https://www.rokcoder.com/scratch) to showcase selected Scratch projects.

Although my site now incorporates a lot of PHP, this version is made entirely with JavaScript and HTML to make it easier to understand and host - I thought it was a landing page that others might enjoy using for their own projects.

There are a few image files but the main body of code is contained in `index.html`, `rokcoder.css` (which contains a lot of garbage and a handful of useful stuff), `projectViewer.js` and `data.js`. To adapt this for your own website you only need to modify `data.js`. I think the format of that file is pretty self-evident.
